study specs/readme.md study jtbd.md and pick the most important thing to do - your task is implement then to validate that this functionaltiy works.

IMPORTANT:

update the jtbd plan when the task is done
you may implement missing functionaltiy if required (but study the specs/ before doing so)
if integration/property/unit tests are missing you should add them (but choose which one is most appropraite. follow existing test pattern design)
Run tests. If they fail, fix the code.
commit your changes with a descriptive message and push when you are done
Once you have committed your changes and updated the plan, exit immediately.
